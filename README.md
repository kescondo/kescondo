- ðŸ˜„ Hello! I'm Kristina (she/her), and I recently finished up my program at Tech Elevator, a 14-week in-person full-stack coding bootcamp. I'm excited to start my journey as a software developer and would love to connect!
- ðŸ“« Personal coding goal: at least one commit per day 5 days/week to keep up my coding skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Final capstone: Using Java, SQL, and Vue.js, my team and I built a meal planning app end-to-end that allows public users to search for recipes using a web API. Authenticated users can also save recipes to their library and create and modify a daily meal plan. See a description and some screen shots of this work in the MEALPLAN_README.md file.
- ðŸ”­ Side projects in progress:
  * Home management app: this will track family to-do lists, schedules, a caregiver's timesheet, and *stretch-goal!) find local family-friendly activities.
  * Tech stack: Java, SQL, Vue (JavaScript)
    - [x] To-do lists 
    - [ ] Schedule
    - [ ] Timesheet
  * Candy shop app: reworking a mini-capstone project that originally used a CLI so that it's a full-stack application.
  * Tech stack: Java, SQL, Angular (TypeScript)
    - [x] Built database tables for user stories (below)
    - [x] Wrote DAOs, Controller methods, APIs (tested in Postman) for user stories
    - [x] Created Home page component in Angular
    - [ ] Connect front and backend
    - [ ] View list of available candies
- ðŸ’¬ My tech stack presently includes Java, Spring Boot, SQL, HTML/CSS, and Vue.js.  
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Angular (and, by extension, TypeScript) and am working through the Homes tutorial on Angular.io. React and Kotlin are next!
- âš¡ I'm interested in full-stack, front-end, or mobile development. I'm excited to collaborate, and I welcome constructive feedback!
