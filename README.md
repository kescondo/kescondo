### Intro
- ðŸ˜„ Hello! I'm Kristina (she/her), and I finished my program at Tech Elevator, a 14-week in-person full-stack coding bootcamp, in December 2023. While my original goal was to start my journey as a software developer, this journey is on pause for a few months due to personal circumstances. 
- ðŸ“« To keep my skills sharp and keep learning, I will be working through [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) to learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript.
- âš¡ I'm interested in full-stack, front-end, or mobile development. I'm excited to collaborate, and I welcome constructive feedback!
  
### Tech stack / learning
- ðŸ’¬ Current tech stack: Java, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js.
- âš¡ Familiarity with Angular: Completed both Homes and Tour of Heroes tutorials on Angular.io.
- ðŸŒ± Personal coding/learning goal: Complete 1 part of Full Stack Open approximately every two weeks.
  * Current progress: Part 0/14
- âœ¨ Some of my favorite practice sites: CodeSignal, CodeWars, Codecademy Pro. [Get 50% off an annual plan here!](https://codecademy.referralrock.com/l/KRISTINA77/)
  
### Projects
- ðŸ‘¯ Final capstone: Using Java, SQL, and Vue.js, my team and I built a meal planning app end-to-end that allows public users to search for recipes using a web API. Authenticated users can also save recipes to their library and create and modify a daily meal plan. See a description and some screen shots of this work in the MEALPLAN_README.md file.
