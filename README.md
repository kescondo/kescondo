### Intro
- 😄 Hello! I'm Kristina (she/her), and I recently finished up my program at Tech Elevator, a 14-week in-person full-stack coding bootcamp. I'm excited to start my journey as a software developer and would love to connect!
- 📫 Personal 2024 coding goal: at least one commit OR 3 coding problems per day 5 days/week to keep up my coding skills.
- ⚡ I'm interested in full-stack, front-end, or mobile development. I'm excited to collaborate, and I welcome constructive feedback!
  
### Tech stack / learning
- 💬 My tech stack presently includes Java, Spring Boot, SQL, HTML/CSS, and Vue.js.  
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Angular (and, by extension, TypeScript). I finished the Homes tutorial and am now working through the Tour of Heroes tutorial on Angular.io.
- 🌱 I also just started learning React and finished the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial on React.dev. 
- ✨ I'm keeping my coding skills strong by working through problems on CodeSignal.

### Projects
- 👯 Final capstone: Using Java, SQL, and Vue.js, my team and I built a meal planning app end-to-end that allows public users to search for recipes using a web API. Authenticated users can also save recipes to their library and create and modify a daily meal plan. See a description and some screen shots of this work in the MEALPLAN_README.md file.
