- 👯 Final capstone: Using Java, SQL, and Vue.js, my team and I built a meal planning app end-to-end that allows public users to search for recipes using a web API. Authenticated users can also save recipes to their library and create and modify a daily meal plan. See a description and some screen shots of this work in the MEALPLAN_README.md file.
